# Aurora Innovation ai-case-study
## Aurora Innovation is a company that envions using a fleet of Autonomous vechichels to be used in freight shipping and ridesharing.
* Aurora Innovation
* Founded: 2017
* Aurora was founded by Chris Urmson, Sterling Anderson, and Drew Bagnell
*  Google, Tesla, and Uber funded and came up with the idea to implement autonomus vehichles for large shipments
*  Funding is both Private and Public. The company has currently funded $820 million.

## Business Activities
* Aurora Innovation believe that the benefits of self-driving technology will increase efficiency and mobility, while bringing a reliable driver supply and heightened safety to Americaâ€™s roads.
* Company primarily targes logistic companies such as FedEx, Uber Freight, Schneider, and more.
* The core of Aurora technology is the Aurora Driver, their continuously improving, intelligent autonomous driving system, designed to see, understand, and safely traverse the world around it.
* Aurora Driver is the main piece of technology uses in the company and it's implemented in most commercial or passenger vehicles. The software uses data from it's sensors to devise a safe path on any given route.

## Landscape
* Aurora Innovation is in the Self-Driving technology field
* Over the last 5-10 years, this field has had dramatic funding and development towards developing safer self-driving systems. We have gone from adaptive cruise control to fully functional taxi services and bus systems. The latest strech has been pushing self driving into daily drivin cars such as Mercedes-Benz.
* Aurora continues to grow in funding and technology while other companies are struggling. Self driving trucks put Aurora out in front to provide enough funding for well into 2025.

## Results
* Aurora is building self-driving technology that will revolutionize the future of transportation. In that goal they have been standing out in front of other companies. Safety has been a top goal in the business and shines through more effectively on the market.
* Tested by incident reports and crashes, Aurora has stood out has one the safest driving companies with the least amount of incidents over the past 3 years now.

## Recommendations
* I would reccomend this company also lean into naval transportation of cargo or ship freights. If already a leading competitor on land transportation, it is time to look out towards the open waters.
* The services that Aurora could offer this way are vital to effeciant and safe transport of materials without risk to other ships and crew.
* Other technologies this service would need would require some kind of underwater detection, weather, and Global positioning relative to other vessals.
* Without these other technologies, the vessal would certainly stall out on open water or crash into other objects and ships.
